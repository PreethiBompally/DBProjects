# DB_Project-1

The following relational operations are implemented in the "Table.java"
- Project
- Select
- Union
- Minus
- Join (equi join, theta join, natural join)

The project #1 folder has 3 files 
1. KeyType.java
2. MovieDB.java
3. Table.java

- we have created a folder "store"  which saves all table data.This folder has to be in the same directory as project #1 folder.

Execution:

1. Run "MovieDB.java" which has main method. This creates, inserts and saves tables' data.
2. This main method calls all the relational operations that are implemented in "Table.java".

Note: 
The input string condition for theta join and select(String condition) should contain blank space(" ") between the operators and the operand.
Example : "attribute1 <op> attribute2"
